It is minimalistic static website, containing main info about myself as a person and developer. I am junior dev, so this is portfolio website v1.0. It got links to my social media, such as Linkedin and Github. Also contains my resume in order to download it directly from the internet and perfectly working contact form if anybody would like to send me a quick feedback about first impression.
